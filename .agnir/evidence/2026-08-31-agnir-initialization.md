# Agnir Initialization — 2026-08-31

## Problem

`CineHarbor/cineharbor-worker` did not yet have Agnir durable Project continuity.

## Resolution

Initialized Agnir under the `repository-filesystem/0.1` profile:

- top-level `AGNIR.yaml` with Core version `"0.1"`, discovery profile `repository-filesystem/0.1`, Project identity `urn:cineharbor:project:cineharbor-worker`, and repository extension `canonical: "CineHarbor/cineharbor-worker"` / `authoritative_ref: "main"`;
- colocated durable memory `.agnir/state.md`, `.agnir/next-actions.md`, `.agnir/decisions.md`, and `.agnir/evidence/`;
- `README.md` canonical `## Agnir Project Instructions` section (merged; existing content preserved);
- root `AGENTS.md` locator pointing to that README section.

## Fresh activation

Verified cold start from the Project root: `AGENTS.md` → README `Agnir Project Instructions` → `AGNIR.yaml` → declared durable memory, with no dependency on the initialization conversation.

## Compatibility boundary

Core `0.1`; repository/filesystem profile `repository-filesystem/0.1`. No Agnir Core semantics changed.
